Current Schemas for backend models (Mainly used to help me build the front end models.)

Users:

SuperUser {
  email: String,
  password: String,
  fname: String,
  lname: String,
  address: String,
  company: String,
  telephone: String,
  subusers: Array of ObjectIds referencing SubUsers
}

SubUser {
  email: String,
  password: String,
  fname: String,
  lname: String,
  telephone: String,
  superuserid: String of a SuperUser's ID (might get changed into an ObjectId referencing SuperUser)
}

SAQ Stuff:

Question {
  questiontext: String,
  answertype: Number,
  _id: Manually set ID to help us better track questions
}

SAQTemplate {
  name: String,
  questions: Array of ID strings referencing questions
}
