Current Schemas for backend models (Mainly used to help me build the front end models.)

Users:

SuperUser {
  email: String,
  password: String,
  fname: String,
  lname: String,
  address: String,
  company: String,
  telephone: String,
  subusers: Array of ObjectIds referencing SubUsers
}

SubUser {
  email: String,
  password: String,
  fname: String,
  lname: String,
  telephone: String,
  superuserid: ObjectId referencing SuperUser
}

SAQ Stuff:

Question {
  questiontext: String,
  answertype: Number (0 for free-response, 1 for MC),
  answers: [String] (Only relevant for answertype 1, basically the choices),
  _id: Manually set ID to help us better track questions (This one is a string while every other ID is an ObjectId)
}

SAQTemplate {
  name: String,
  questions: Array of ID strings referencing questions
}

Account SAQ {
  superuserid: ObjectId referencing superuserid
  name: String,
  questionsandanswers: JSON object,
  templateid: ObjectId referencing SAQ template
}
